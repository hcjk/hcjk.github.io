    <h1 class="measure f1 black-80">Hello, I’m Henry Kaufman.
        <br>
        I have a knack for creating products.</h1>
    <p class="measure lh-copy f4 black-70">
        Growing up, I always had a passion for building stuff. As a young kid, I’d fantasize over the latest LEGO. When
        I wasn’t building things out of LEGOs, I would be building out of other materials such as cardboard. No matter
        what, I was always making. My family would go to the Children’s Museum in Denver and I would spend the entire
        time build various things in the maker section. As I grew older, I built my first computer, and learned the
        power of technology and the internet. In seventh grade, I was introduced to Minecraft and quickly became
        addicted. I could build whatever I want, whenever I wanted. Soon after, my friend introduced me to coding, and
        the development of iOS applications.
        <br><br>
        Soon enough, I started building my own mini projects on the weekends and in spare time. I would build mini sites
        that displayed various information. I made a site about school. I made a site for every family vacation I went
        on. This hobby of mine continued to expand, and I quickly realized that many people do this for a living. I
        looked into freelancing, but was nervous about the current competition. Nonetheless, I decided to put myself out
        there, but had little to no success.
        <br><br>
        High school was where everything began to take off. During my freshman year, I joined TSA (Technology Student
        Association), where I took my coding skills to a competition. This coding competition proved itself as a very
        valuable learning experience for myself. We did not win that year (not even come close), but I learned that
        there were other students out there doing this same thing. Before this, I felt like I was the only person my age
        doing this—I was wrong.
        <br><br>
        As sophomore year began again, I started TSA with a passion to win. Our team ended up winning 3rd place at the
        state competition, giving us a seat at the national competition in June. During my sophomore year of high
        school, I was able to connect with a fellow young entrepreneur in Denver named Carter. Carter was a 25 year old
        who was interested in building cool products together. This matched my interest. Nervous about meeting this
        person by myself, I brought my best friend <a href="http://jakebillings.com"
                                                      class="link underline-hover black b" target="_blank">Jake</a> (a
        fellow
        developer), along. Carter introduced us to Greg, the
        CEO of <a href="http://canadianhomebuyersacademy.com" class="link underline-hover black b" target="_blank">Canadian
        Home Buyers
        Academy</a>, where we began to work on building a platform for customers to interact with their mortgages. We
        continued this adventure and began to work with other companies like nexleader and LeadLogica.
        <br><br>
        Over the summer of 2016 I was highly encouraged by my parents to find an internship with a “real company.” After
        some searching in a few Slack channels, I ended up at <a href="http://barbershop.io"
                                                                 class="link underline-hover black b"
                                                                 target="_blank">Barbershop</a>, a creative technology
        studio based out of Denver, as a Creative Technology Intern. I had a blast, and was able to learn incredible
        team skills that I would have never learned just solo freelancing. I learned how to work better with others, and
        understand transparency between teammates. At the end of the summer I launched a site to explore posts on <a
            href="http://explore.winluncher.com" class="link underline-hover black b" target="_blank">Luncher</a>, a
        gamified social platform for people to share their lunches on.
        <br><br>
        In the fall after school started, I began to work on other side projects with other friends and release more
        products. A recent project I worked on was <a href="http://disrupt.cards" class="link underline-hover black b"
                                                      target="_blank">Disrupt Cards</a>, a card game designed to make
        the world a better place through crude humor aimed at the startup community. I teamed up with another friend
        <a href="http://twitter.com/techvoltz" class="link underline-hover black b" target="_blank">Nikhil</a>, and we
        launched a <a href="http://marketinggigs.co" class="link underline-hover black b" target="_blank">job board</a>
        for marketing professionals and a <a href="http://bestdocpages.co" class="link underline-hover black b"
                                             target="_blank">site</a> curating the best company documentation pages.
        <br><br>
        Recently, Canadian Home Buyers Academy has now pivoted themselves into <a href="http://blinkmortgage.ca"
                                                                                  class="link underline-hover black b"
                                                                                  target="_blank">Blink Mortgage</a>,
        with the idea in mind of helping people find mortgages, quickly, easily, and painlessly. In the coming months,
        we plan on launching a totally redesigned version of the application, with the customer experience in mind. I’ve
        also teamed up with the team at <a href="http://galvanize.com" class="link underline-hover black b"
                                           target="_blank">Galvanize</a> and am currently helping them build a <a
            href="http://intrn.co" class="link underline-hover black b" target="_blank">platform</a> to help students
        find internships.
        <br><br>
        Anyways, this is where I am at now. I believe this is just the start.
