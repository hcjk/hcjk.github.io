        <p class="f4 f3-ns measure lh-copy dark-gray">
            Hey there! My name is Henry Kaufman. I'm an product designer based out of Denver, Colorado. I primarily focus on creating incredible user interfaces and ensuring that all user experiences are simple and intuitive. Outside of design, I love to bring designs
            to life through code. I'm a fanatic for writing great code, and building awesome things.

            Over the past few years, I've been able to work with some incredible clients. I've created beautiful ways for home buyers and owners to view their mortgages with <a href="#" class="link gray hover-black" target="_blank">Canadian Home Buyers Academy</a>.
            I've built platforms that have enabled tens of thousands of people to better understand their own personal skillset with <a href="http://myipsat.com" class="link gray hover-black" target="_blank">nexleader</a>. I've spent a summer at <a href="http://barbershop.io"
                class="link gray hover-black" target="_blank">Barbershop</a>, a creative technology studio based out of Denver, building an incredibly fast way for people to find lunches of interest: <a href="http://explore.winluncher.com" class="link gray hover-black"
                target="_blank">Luncher Photos</a>.

            Recently, I've had the opportunity to create some incredible products with my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/jayhxmo" class="link gray hover-black" target="_blank">Jay</a>. We've been working together on <a href="http://digon.io" class="link gray hover-black">Digon</a>,
            a team that's dedicated to building useful products.
