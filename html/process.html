        <li><b>Research</b>
            <br>
            <p>One of the most crucial and critical steps to the whole process is researching the product, competitors, and potential solutions. Because of this, I consider this the most important step in the process. Researching generally involves getting a stronger grasp on the product, what it does, what the issue is, and possible ways to improve it.</p>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Analysis</b>
            <br>
            <p>Analysis provides a structure in which a product can be built upon. It is because it involves choosing the best solution for the product or task at hand.</p>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Design</b>
            <br>
            <p>This step is the most important step to a site's users. By creating a beautiful and usabiliy focused design, I create a whole new level in which users can interact with. The first time a user visits a site, the first thing that they see is the design. I build designs that grasp a user's attention within the first few seconds of visiting.</p>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Development</b>
            <br>
            <p>The development of a product is another incredibly important part of the process. With development, I create a seamless, easy to use site that is focused on being fast and efficient for the user. Similarly to design, the site needs to be swift and able to handle a large amount of traffic.</p>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><b>=Tests</b>
            <br>
            <p>A critical step to the process is testing, in other words, making sure that it works <i>completely</i>. I test on many devices and browsers to ensure a solid and fluid experience throughout.</p>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Integration</b>
            <br>
            <p>Integrating is the final step of the process, but definitely an essential one. Integration is the process by which I implement the product that I've built into a user's product. I provide a smooth and easy integration without server drops or any latency for users.</p>
